# Final Project of CSC249/449
Welcome to the final project of CSC249/449!

In this final project, you are going to build deep learning models for two tasks on A2D dataset. Please read *final_project.pdf* for more details of the project requirement.



## Preparation

Before start working on a specific task, please do the following preparation on your **Google Cloud**.

- **Clone the repository**

  Please use the following command to clone this repository (please do not download the zip file):

  ```bash
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/rochesterxugroup/csc249_final_proj_2020.git
  ```

  If there is any updates of the repository, please use the following commands to update:

  ```bash
  git submodule update --remote --merge
  git pull --recurse-submodules
  ```

  cd to the cloned repo:

  ```bash
  cd csc249_final_proj_2020
  ```

- **Environment Configuration**

  1. Download and install miniconda from https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh (You can skip this step if miniconda is installed on your google cloud server.)

  2. Install the virtual enviroment and its dependencies by:

     ```bash
     conda env create -f env.yml
     ```

  3. Activate the virtual environment by (please remember to activate virtual environment everytime you login on google cloud):

     ```bash
     conda activate pytorch_0_4_1
     ```

  4. Then, install Pytorch 0.4.1 and torchvision. (You can try newer version of PyTorch, but we don't guarantee the code template can work with a different environment.)

     ```bash
     conda install pytorch=0.4.1 cuda92 -c pytorch
     conda install torchvision
     ```

  5. Install the ffmpeg via

     ```bash
     sudo apt install ffmpeg
     ```

- **Download A2D dataset**

  Please make sure you are at the `csc249_final_proj` directory.

  1. Download the A2D dataset

     ```bash
     wget http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~cxu22/t/249S19/A2D.tar.gz
     ```

     If wget is not install on the server, please install wget via

     ```wget
     sudo apt install wget
     ```

  2. Decompress the tar ball and remove tar ball.

     ```bash
     tar xvzf A2D.tar.gz
     rm A2D.tar.gz
     ```

  3. Extract frames from videos

     (Tip: Since it takes a long time to extract frames from video, you can execute the command in  `screen` or `tmux`, in case the disconnection happens.)

     ```bash
     python extract_frames.py
     ```



## Submission

Please read `submission/README.md` for more details of submission format.
