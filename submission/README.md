# Submission

This is the template of submission.

Put your submission of each task in `cls`, `det`, and `seg` folder.

In each folder, please include the following files:

- code - The implementation of your model.
- write_up.pdf - In this Ô¨Åle, please explain you models of each task in several aspects:
  - Method description (e.g., preprocessing method, network architecture (pretrained or not), losses, optimization method, number of iterations/epochs of convergence, hyperparameters, etc.).
  - Novelty of your method, which cannot be too simple (e.g., more training epochs, larger learning rate).
  - Performance on validation set.

- Prediction result on testing set. Please refer to README.md of each code template for more details.



Finally, **zip** this folder to `submission.zip`. Please do not use other archive formats (e.g. rar, tar, etc.).
