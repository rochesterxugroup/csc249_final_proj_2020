# Submission

This is the template of submission.

In this folder, please include the following files:

- code - The implementation of your model.
- write_up.pdf - In this Ô¨Åle, please explain you models of each task in several aspects:
  - Method description (e.g., preprocessing method, network architecture (pretrained or not), losses, optimization method, number of iterations/epochs of convergence, hyperparameters, etc.).
  - Novelty of your method, which cannot be too simple (e.g., more training epochs, larger learning rate).
  - Performance on validation set.

- presentation.pdf (or presentation.ppt(x)) - This file is a presentation version of the write up. Method description, novelty, and performance should be reported in this file.
- *netID*.pkl - Prediction result on testing set. Please refer to README.md of the code template for more details. Replace *netID* with your real netID.



Finally, **zip** this folder to `submission.zip`. Note that please **zip the folder** instead of selecting all files of this folder and zip. Please do not use other archive formats (e.g. rar, tar, etc.).
